# Shopping Card Functionality- Using React-Redux

This is my Small Shopping Card Application. Basically, I have applied my Redux knowledge to react project. This project is using Html, CSS, javascript, react, redux, and tailwindcss.All state management functionality using redux. For design, purposes use tailwindcss CDN Link. When calculating the total amount, I use the javascript reduce higher-order function. This project does not have backend. All data fetch in a local folder in JSON format.
